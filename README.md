Hi!

I want to certify CKA so this is my logbook for everything I've done so far. Some milestones I wanted to achieve:

- Three Raspberry Pi 5: 1 would be the master node, 2 workers
- Use Raspberry Pi OS as-is. Modify whatever is necessary at the kernel level or installed packages so kubeadm works
- Use non-deprecated (or soon to be deprecated) CNIs, e.g., Cilium
- Use Kubernetes v1.35 (currently just released)

All my manual work was documented in `docs/instructions-manually.md`. Go check it if you're interested. I might add some scripts to avoid manual work later.
